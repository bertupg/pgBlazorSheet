# pgBlazorSheet

Very naive approach to show tabular data in excel-style grid, with support of
some degree of interaction, all with native blazor wasm, without inclusion of
any third party javascript libraries

Obviously, the goal is not replicate excel itself or other spreadsheet
applications, but just make a reusable control to display data (and even input,
if possibile) in a way that can be familiar to users accustomed to spreadsheets.
